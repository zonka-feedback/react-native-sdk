# JS Web Client

To display and trigger Zonka Feedback Survey widget on your website or within your app or product, you need to install the Zonka Feedback JS Client Code (a JavaScript code) on your website (or in-app).

First, let's understand the different types of web widgets offered in Zonka Feedback. We offer 5 types of Web Widgets.

* **Side Tab (Feedback Button)**\
  Side Tab or Website Feedback Button is a tab or button that is used to collect feedback from your online website visitors and customers while they browse your website or use your app. The Side Tab can be placed on the left or right side of your Web Page or App so it's easy to find for users to share their experience and feedback.
* **Pop-up Survey**\
  Pop-up are forms and surveys that are displayed on a web page or app based on an event or visitor/user behavior. Pop-Up Surveys are great to use as exit intent surveys, cart abandonment surveys, post-transaction and post-booking surveys, lead generation forms, or time-based surveys.
* **Popover Survey**\
  Popover Surveys are surveys that open in an overlay on a web page with a click of a button or link. Unlike Pop-up Surveys that are triggered by an event or time, Popover Surveys are triggered by the user's action of clicking a button or a link. Popover Surveys are ideal for in-context feedback like feature feedback, article or blog feedback, CTAs and more.
* **Slide Up Survey**\
  Slide Up Surveys are forms and surveys that are displayed on a web page or app based on an event or visitor/user behavior. Pop-Up Surveys are great to use as exit intent surveys, cart abandonment surveys, post-transaction and post-booking surveys, lead generation forms, or time-based surveys.

In Web Widgets, you can configure settings for Widget Appearance, Widget Targeting, and Behavior to display the surveys at the right time to the right user.
